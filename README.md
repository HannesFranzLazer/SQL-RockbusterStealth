# SQL-RockbusterStealth
 As a data analyst, I prepared a presentation outlining key objectives for Rockbuster Stealth's managers. I also compiled an Excel file containing SQL queries for my colleagues and developed a data dictionary to aid in daily data interpretation.

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
The "Rockbuster Data Set" is a comprehensive collection of information, including details on Rockbuster stores, staff, inventory, film categories, languages, actors, customer demographics, rental history, payment patterns, and geographical data. This data set forms the basis for detailed analysis and was curated and provided by CareerFoundry.

## Tools
The data was analyzed using a relational database management system and PostgreSQL.

## Visualizations
All visualizations were created in Tableau Public and may be viewed in the attached [Tableau Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannes.franz.lazer/vizzes).
